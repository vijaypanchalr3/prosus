    abstract = {A completely automated ac susceptometer is constructed to measure phase resolved linear and nonlinear ac susceptibility. Measurements over a wide range of experimental variables, such as ac and superimposed dc fields up to 300 Oe, frequency from 1 Hz to 100 kHz, and temperature from 77 to 300 K are made using only a lock-in amplifier (LIA), a PC, and some simple electronic circuits. A temperature-measurement and control unit is built utilizing the analog–digital input and digital–analog output of the LIA. Using a proportional and integral algorithm, a control accuracy better than 50 mK is achieved. The overall sensitivity of the setup is better than 10−7 emu and a reproducibility better than 0.1},

    abstract = {The absolute magnetic susceptibility of cylindrical specimens is obtained with an ac susceptometer whose calibration is based on a calculation of mutual inductance. An axially magnetized cylinder is modeled as a solenoid of the same size. The mutual inductance between such a solenoid and a pickup coil of arbitrary dimensions is computed. The susceptibility is then a function of the mutual inductance, the cylinder length, the magnitude and frequency of the ac magnetizing field, and the voltage induced on the pickup coil. Demagnetization factor and eddy‐current effects are considered, an example is given, and pickup coil compensation is discussed. Other calibration methods are also presented.},

These compounds exhibit notable correlations among their spin, charge, lattice, and polar degrees of freedom.     Ba 3   CoRu 2   O 9 displays a pronounced frequency-dependent relaxation in    χ  2 , 3 just above the magnetoelastic transition, occurring around 100 K, followed by an abrupt loss of polarization within the ordered phase. In     Ba 3   BiRu 2   O 9, we encounter the possibility of multiple coexisting relaxation behaviors, indicating a complex phase strongly influenced by the spin-gap opening at 175 K. Lastly,     Sr 3   CaRu 2   O 9 displays anomalies with strong dispersion effects close to its magnetic transitions, indicating a robust coupling between magnetic and dipolar orders in the system. These measurements highlight the significance of higher-order (hyper-)susceptibilities in providing profound insight into the dynamics of a system, offering information otherwise inaccessible through the linear polarization response alone.},

    abstract = {A fully automatized alternating current (ac) susceptometer is constructed for simultaneous measurements of the phase resolved complex linear and complex nonlinear ac susceptibilities of lossy and dispersive dielectric materials. This relatively simple setup allows measurements over a wide range of experimental variables, such as ac amplitudes up to 40 V, frequencies from 10−2 to 103 Hz, and temperatures from 100 to 600 K utilizing only current/voltage and analog/digital converters and a personal computer. In contrast with the commonly used analysis of the charge accumulated on a standard capacitor in series with the sample our method is based on the analysis of the current flowing directly through the sample. Absence of any capacitive voltage dividers in the measurement circuit eliminates uncontrolled phase shifts. This is why the instrument provides high quality, nonlinear susceptibility data and in particular appears as a very convenient tool for discrimination between continuous and discontinuous phase transitions when determining the sign of the real part of the third order dielectric susceptibility.},

abstract={Magnetic susceptibility measurements are often the first characterization tool that researchers turn to when beginning to assess the magnetic nature of a newly discovered material. Breakthroughs in instrumentation have made the collection of high quality magnetic susceptibility data more accessible than ever before. However, the analysis of susceptibility data remains a common challenge for newcomers to the field of magnetism. While a comprehensive treatment of the theoretical aspects of magnetism are found in numerous excellent textbooks, there is a gap at the point of practical application. We were inspired by this obstacle to put together this guide to the analysis and interpretation of magnetic susceptibility data, with an emphasis on materials that exhibit Curie-Weiss paramagnetism.},
