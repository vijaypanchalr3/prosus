This is our master’s semester four project report. We have done work on instrumentation for finding magnetic susceptibility of unknown samples. Our final goal is to find phase transitions of samples under change of temperature. Which we didn’t do in this project, but will remain for future. In this project report we talked about proper use cases of AC susceptometer and then instrumentation in Experimental setup. We used Primary and Secondary coil setup, thus exploiting mutual inductance to find remaining magnetization of sample under AC susceptometer. Main coils are connected to SR830 LOCK IN amplifiers. Proper Scripts and instrumentation regarding data logging and computer setup is done in our semester 3 project\cite{Panchal2024gb}\cite{Panchal}. You can visit my github page at https://github.com/vijaypanchalr3/pyinstro and https://github.com/vijaypanchalr3/shotnoise for python code regarding it. We have took extensive help from (Laurent, 2008)\cite{cambr}, (miga, 2007)\cite{10.1063/1.2712792}, (bajpai, 1997)\cite{10.1063/1.1148349}. Also, articles by (goldfarb,1986)\cite{10.1063/1.1137813}, (chakravarty, 2024)\cite{10.1063/5.0182471} are very useful.
