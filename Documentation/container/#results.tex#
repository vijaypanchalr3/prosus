Our result is partitioned in partitions related with steps we took in our project. This is MSc project thatâ€™s why we wrote this way. First part is the initial plots which shows how  our instrument works. This shows position-dependent graphs of ferromagnetic substances (Iron). This shows some sinusoidal curve which is logical and we can find maximum magnetization at a certain distance into secondary coils. This is that curve,

Now, comes the calibration result of our samples. We took four samples for calibration, these are $Fe_2O3$, Nickel, LSMO(full name) and $Gd_2O_3$. These are voltage graphs.

We made some inference that
