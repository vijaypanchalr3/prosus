       We have work on Instrumentation of AC susceptometer. The instrument is made of concentric coils termed as primary and secondary coils. We have exploited Mutual inductance of secondary coil to measure magnetization of sample. Instrument is connected with a LOCK IN amplifier which gives a reference signal to the primary coil and measures the output signal from secondary. We also designed a Temperature control and measuring setup. This is all connected to the main computer and capable of taking reading automatically. Reading can be taken of any sample, with frequency range 1mHz to 1Mhz, temperature range room temperature to 550K. We calibrate our system with two ferromagnetic substances, nickel and LSMO. Instruments have high noise levels but can be used for finding phase transitions for any sample which have high magnetic susceptibility in any one of the phases around curie temperature.
