Our result is partitioned in partitions related with steps we took in our project. This is MSc project thatâ€™s why we wrote this way. First part is the initial plots which shows how  our instrument works. This shows position-dependent graphs of ferromagnetic substances (Iron). This shows some sinusoidal curve which is logical and we can find maximum magnetization at a certain distance into secondary coils. This is that curve,
